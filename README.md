![Tests](https://github.com/sunny/actor-rails/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

ServiceActor-Rails provides Rails support for the
[ServiceActor](https://github.com/sunny/actor) gem.

## Installation

Add these lines to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
# Composable service objects
gem "service_actor-rails"
```

## Usage

You can use the `actor` generator:

```sh
rails generate actor create_order
```

Creates `app/actors/create_order.rb`:

```ruby
class CreateOrder < Actor
  def call
  end
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake` to run the tests and linting. You can also run `bin/console` for an
interactive prompt.

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and in the
`CHANGELOG.md`, run `rake`, and create a commit for this version. You can then
run `rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git
commits and tags, and push the gem to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
